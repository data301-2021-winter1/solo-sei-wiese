## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Looking at the correlation between a variety of inequality indicators and perceptions of corruption, measured by the Corruption Perception Index (CPI). This will be focused on the top 25 most developed countries in Africa. The country set was chosen because they are both geographically linked and are likely to have a large amount of data collected on them while still having some instability and likelihood for corruption. Theoretically, higher rates of inequality will predict higher perceptions of corruption in a country. However, it is not clear which index of inequality is a better indicator of inequality, or if any have a high correlation. Since we are analyzing so many countries, we can also address whether a subgroup, defined by some other characteristic, shows this correlation between inequality and CPI better than others. Hopefully, the analysis shows a stronger between one measure of ineqaulity and CPI which is consistant along all the countries we are studying. This topic is especially relevent considering the recent breaking of the Pandora papers. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data is a combination of data from the World Inequality Database and Transparency International. The World Inequality Database (WID) is an open database with the aim of providing the most extensive dataset on Inequality. WID will provide eleven variables regarding inequality and a few related national characteristics such as GDP per capita. The Inequality data is based on ratios of percentage national income go to a percent subclass of the economy. Transparency International measures the Corruption Perceptions Index index which will be the comparative measure in our data analysis. Both datasets were collected for the purposes of providing open data on these issues, and both relied on Neo-liberal institutions, such as World Bank and IMF for their data. The data in our dataset will only include 25 developed countries over the past ~20 years, 1998-2019, even though both datasets include data from almost every country for the past 50 years.
